Introduction
============

Qwt uses qmake to build all its components and examples. 
qmake is part of a Qt distribution. 

qmake reads project files, that contain the options and rules how to 
build a certain project. A project file ends with the suffix "*.pro". 
Files that end with the suffix "*.pri" are included by the project 
files and contain definitions, that are common for several project files.

qwtconfig.pri is read by all project files of the Qwt package.
So the first step is to edit qwtconfig.pri to adjust it to your
needs.

MathML Extension
================

Qwt/Qt4 supports the MathML render engine from the Qt solutions package,
that is only available with a commercial Qt license.

You need a release of qtmmlwidget >= 2.1.
Copy the files qtmmlwidget.[cpp|h] to textengines/mathml.

A) Unix (+ MacOSX) Qt3/Qt4
==========================

qmake
make
make install

If you didn't enable autobuilding of the examples in qwtconfig.pri
you have to build the examples this way:

cd examples
qmake 
make

If you like to run the examples, don't forget to install the 
Qwt library/plugins or set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH to the lib directory 
of your local build. ( On some systems LIBPATH is used instead, on MacOSX
it is called DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH. )

B) Win32/MSVC Qt3/Qt4
=====================

Please read the qmake documentation how to convert 
your *.pro files into your development environment.

F.e MSVC with nmake:
qmake qwt.pro
nmake

If you didn't enable autobuilding of the examples in qwtconfig.pri
you have to build the examples this way:

cd examples
nmake examples.pro
nmake

admin/msvc-qmake.bat helps users of Visual Studio users to
generate makefiles or project files (.dsp for MSVC-6.0 or vcproj for 
MSVC.NET) for Qwt.

To generate makefiles, type: "admin\msvc-qmake"
To generate project files, type: "admin\msvc-qmake vc"

C) Win32/MinGW Qt4
==================

If you use the MinGW compiler from the MSYS shell do:

export MINGW_IN_SHELL=1;

qmake 
make -i
make install

If you didn't enable autobuilding of the examples in qwtconfig.pri
you have to build the examples this way:

D) MacOSX

Well, the Mac is only another Unix system. So read the instructions in A).


D) Qtopia Core

I only tested Qwt with Qtopia Core in qvfb (Virtual Framebuffer Devivce)
Emulator on my Linux box. To build Qwt for the emulator was as simple as 
for a regular Unix build.

qmake
make

E) Qtopia (!= Qtopia Core)

I once compiled the Qwt library against Qtopia 4.2.0 successfully - but
not more. It should be possible to build and install Qwt, but it's
not done yet.

Good luck !
