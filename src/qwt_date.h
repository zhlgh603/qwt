/*!
  \brief A collection of methods around date/time values

  Qt offers convenient classes for dealing date/time values.
  As the coordinate system is based on doubles QwtDate offers
  methods to translate QDateTime to double and v.v.

  A double is interpreted as the number of milliseconds since
  1970-01-01T00:00:00 Universal Coordinated Time - also known
  as "The Epoch". As the significance of a double is below
  the available in QDateTime the translation is not bijective with
  rounding errors for dates very far from Epoch.

  While the range of the julian day in Qt4 is limited in the range
  between [0, MAX_INT], Qt5 stores it as qint64 offering a huge range
  of valid dates. As the significance of a double is below
  the available in QDateTime the translation is not bijective with
  rounding errors for dates very far from Epoch.

  An axis for a date/time interval is expected to be aligned
  and divided in time/date units like seconds, minutes, ...
  QwtDate offers several algorithms that are needed to
  calculate these axes.
